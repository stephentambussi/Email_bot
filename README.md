# Email_bot
=============================================================
 A simple email bot written in Python using yagmail libraries.
 - Made for the RealSource leasing procedure email list (Fall 2020)
 - Has the ability to send emails with an alias (to make it look like it came from another address)
    - This was so that I could send multiple emails to one address to increase our spots in the email list
 - Takes input from a text file named 'message0.txt'(message1.txt... and so on)
    - Can take as many text files as needed
 - Text files formatted with the 'from' address on first line, second line blank, then message after that.
